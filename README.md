# Upflow

## Introduction

This repository maintains our  batch data pipelines built as Airflow [DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) that will be scheduled and executed using the popular workflow orchestrator  [Airflow](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow).
Upflow is responsible for data warehouse management tasks and data quality and integrity checks that need to be executed periodically.
